# API Documentation

We use [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) as our documentation tool, which has out-of-the-box integration with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and 
complies with the OpenAPI specification.

The documentation can be accessed here.

A list of the available endpoints is shown, with an explanation of how each resource can be accessed, which parameters are required, and an example response schema. It's also possible to test each endpoint by clicking **Try it out**.
