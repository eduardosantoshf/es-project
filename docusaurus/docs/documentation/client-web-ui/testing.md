# Testing

The Client Web UI was tested using the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) framework to run the tests.

As the Client Web UI is a React application, we decided to use Selinium to make functional tests. The tests were made using the [Selenium IDE](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/) plugin for the [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) browser.

```javascript
// Generated by Selenium IDE
```

To run the test the application have to be running, and the run the following command:

```bash
yarn run jest
```
